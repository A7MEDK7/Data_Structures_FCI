## 📂 Contents

Each file/folder focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm:

### 🔸 Array Methods
- Basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

### 🔸 Binary Search
- Efficient search algorithm on sorted arrays.
- Implemented using both recursion and iteration.

### 🔸 Linked List
- Singly Linked List implemented from scratch.
- Includes insert, delete, and traverse operations.

### 🔸 Stack
- **Stack using Linked List**  
  Classic implementation using dynamic memory with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.
- **Stack using Array** 
  Static implementation with overflow/underflow checks and all core operations.

### 🔸 Queue
- **Queue using Linked List**  
  Dynamic implementation that supports `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, `isFound`, and more.
- **Queue using Array**  
  Circular array-based implementation handling `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `display`, and utility functions.

### 🔸 Sorting Algorithms
- Includes major sorting techniques:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
