## Contents

Each file in the repo focuses on a specific topic:

- *Array Methods*  
  Basic operations on arrays such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

- *Binary Search*  
  Efficient search algorithm implemented on sorted arrays using recursion and iteration.

- *Linked List*  
  Singly Linked List implemented from scratch with essential operations like insert, delete, and traverse.

- *Sorting Algorithms*  
  Implementation of major sorting techniques:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort

- *Stack using Linked List*  
  Stack data structure implemented using a linked list (includes push, pop, peek, and isEmpty).
