## ðŸ“‚ Contents

Each file/folder focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm:

### ðŸ”¸ Array Methods
- Basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

### ðŸ”¸ Binary Search
- Efficient search algorithm on sorted arrays.
- Implemented using both recursion and iteration.

### ðŸ”¸ Linked List
- Singly Linked List implemented from scratch.
- Includes insert, delete, and traverse operations.

### ðŸ”¸ Stack
- **Stack using Linked List**  
  Classic implementation using dynamic memory with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.
- **Stack using Array** âœ… *(NEW)*  
  Static implementation with overflow/underflow checks and all core operations.

### ðŸ”¸ Queue
- **Queue using Linked List** âœ… *(NEW)*  
  Dynamic implementation that supports `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, `isFound`, and more.
- **Queue using Array** âœ… *(NEW)*  
  Circular array-based implementation handling `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `display`, and utility functions.

### ðŸ”¸ Sorting Algorithms
- Includes major sorting techniques:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

### ðŸ”¸ Trees
- **Full Binary Tree** âœ… *(NEW)*  
  A basic class-based implementation of a binary tree with node insertion and traversal support.
